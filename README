ActsAsRecommendable
===================

ActsAsRecommendable is a plugin for Rails that simplifies collaborative filtering

The plugin provides a mechanism for finding loose associations between users and items which we can tell you
* Given a user, return other similar users based on what items they have all bought/bookmarked/rated/etc
* Given a user, return recommended items based on the items bought/bookmarked/rated/etc by that user and the items bought/bookmarked/rated/etc by other users.

The plugin calculations can be made online and offline and stored using the rails cache (such as memcache) for online retrieval. Online retrieval of recommendations uses item-based collaborative filtering using the offline items similarity matrix stored in the cache. This can give up-to-date results with a much lower processing overhead.

Much thanks to Toby Segaran and his excellent book Programming Collective Intelligence (http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/).

TODO
====
Use join rating scores
Using abitary calculated scores
Similar Items
Recommended Users

Current Release
===============

v0.1 should be considered early alpha and not ready for production applications. Using ratings on the join table is not yet working. Offline recommendations not fully tested.

Lots of performance optimisations still to be done.

Example
=======

class Book < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_many :books, :through => :user_books
  acts_as_recommendable :books, :through => :user_books
